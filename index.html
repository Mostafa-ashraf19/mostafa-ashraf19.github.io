    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m passionate about building 5G core network solutions, cloud-native architectures, and modern software
            systems.</p>
        <p>
            Mostafa Ashraf was born in Cairo, Egypt. He received his B.S. degree in Computer and Systems Engineering
            from the Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt, in 2021.
            He conducted his bachelor's graduation project working in the neuroscience field using a brain-computer
            interface (BCI) and applied this concept to the Steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) area, in a
            wheelchair. The wheelchair had various movement methods like manual and autonomous modes, various machine
            learning algorithms, such as artificial neural networks, and support vector machines. The gradation project
            uses many technologies, including Brain Signals Extraction using EEG, Time Series Signal Processing, Machine
            Learning, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Embedded Systems, Autonomous Navigation, and Motion Planning. The
            graduation project was sponsored by Valeo and IHUb, and it was qualified as one of the top five projects in
            the Middle East, Africa, Russia, and Turkey, in Dell's Envision the Future competition.

            Mostafa joined Google Summer of Code (GSoC21) and provided support to Spirv-fuzz, which is used to explore
            vulnerabilities in graphics drivers on Android and PC devices through various input transformations, and
            metamorphic testing principles. He has strong technical skills in Software Engineering (but not limited to):
            Design patterns, Data Structures, Algorithms, Object-oriented design, Problem-solving, and Multithreading.

            He joined GSoC22, reorganized the CGAL an open-source computational geometry algorithms library to follow
            the Model–view–presenter (MVP) design pattern used Qt to add features that can work during run time, used
            template metaprogramming to handle its data structures, added more features, fixed bugs, and allowed using
            OpenGL.

            He joined GSoC’23 as a mentor in Jenkins responsible for code review and documentation.

            Currently, he's a Software Engineer at Orange Innovation Egypt.
